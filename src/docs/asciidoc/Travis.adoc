== Purpose

This *GitHub* *gradle-asciidoctorj* repository is a full skeleton project to write text using asciidoctor markup stuff using gradle. 

It pays dividends and increases user confidence if we can confirm that a project can be built successfully. Many changes to a project can cause failures that go undetected or unnoticed. An external service that keeps an eye on a project can be useful. A service that builds and tests a project is even more useful, and when reporting is combined with it, this becomes a valuable tool we can use to keep our projects rocking !

TIP: https://travis-ci.com/[Travis Continuous Integration Service] is such a tool. image:travisIcon.png[]

== About Travis

image:Screenshot1.png[See that button top right ?,466,float="right"]*Â©Travis CI, GmbH* from Berlin have created a cool tool to do just that. It only works with code repositories that exist in *GitHub*. 

If you have a *GitHub* account, then to connect *Travis* to your own *GitHub* account, you use your *GitHub* credentials. Actually, you only click a `button` to do it - how cool is that ? Go to this link:  https://travis-ci.com/[travis-ci.com] to try it.

''''

== Steps To Happiness

=== Getting Started

image:Screenshot2.png[See that button top right ?,630,float="right"]After joining *Travis* to your *GitHub* account, *Travis* will harvest details from each public repository in your account. 

After that, you'll see a display like the sample seen here. It should have some of your details. 

Each of the repos found in your account are potential candidates to be built by *Travis*. You can choose some of your own repos to be processed. 

See the *+* plus sign near `My Repositories`? Just click that to view your own projects.   

''''

=== Choose Your Target

image:Screenshot3.png[List of your public repos,630,float="left",role="thumb"] This is the profile page of the account holder. *Travis* offers useful instructions to pick a repo to build and test. 

''''

For this *gradle-asciidoctorj* project, i had to scroll down the page until i found my project. Clicked the `X` next to *gradle-asciidoctorj*. It turned into a green checkmark to confirm *Travis* was happy. Next, went back to the previous panel showing all my repos known to *Travis*.

=== Time to Build

image:Screenshot5.png[No Builds for this Repo,469,float="left",role="thumb"]This should be enough to get your repo to be built. But when we click the name of our repo in the list on the left, we receive this display. 

So no joy there.  

Could not figure out why not until, after more digging, i read these notes about getting started with *Travis*.

''''

http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/[Travis C/I Getting Started]

 *  *Add the .travis.yml file to git, commit and push, to trigger a Travis CI build:*

WARNING: Travis only runs a build on the commits you push *after* adding the repository to Travis. *Note:* even if your project already has a *.travis.yml* file, you need to git push another commit to trigger a build.

'''' 

=== A Little Git Step

Well, ok, reading up on this a bit, *Travis* needs some configuration details to be able to build and test a project. These are declared in a file named *.travis.yml* which is stored in a git project in the root folder of the project. A sample for an asciidoctorj project would look like this :

.travis.yml configuration sample
[source,yml]
----
language: groovy
jdk:
  - oraclejdk11
  - oraclejdk12
notifications:
  email:
    - james.b.northrop@googlemail.com
----
 
When trying to connect this repo to *Travis*, i had a *.travis.yml* configuration that declared `groovy` was the language of choice and since a *build.gradle* file was present, the documents said *travis* would build my project using gradle. But this did not happen. So i changed my `language` declaration from groovy to scala and did another push from my system to *GitHub*. 

== Houston, We Have Lift-off !

=== Why Did It Build ?

Turns out that it was not the language declaration in *.travis.yml* configuration that made *Travis* play nicely, it was the additional git push of another change that triggered the build. Changed my language back to groovy but there are other choices, hopefully one for text - but did not have time to explore. Did a browser refresh and found this:

The left column shows my *GitHub* repos known to *Travis* and their current status. 


''''
  
=== Confirmation

Next went back to check my emails and found this post-build email showing the results of my build and test.

== Success

That was quite a session. It did take some time to become familiar with the linkage between *Travis* and *GitHub*. But at least, for this repository, any future push of another project update, will automatically trigger a *Travis* build and test. I can review the status of my future commitments to selected repos by visiting https://travis-ci.com/[travis-ci.org] and if i'm logged in, i will find a review of my repos showing success and/or failures.

The blue circle in this screenshot points to an icon. This icon is green if the most recent build was a success or red for failures. Click on the icon for more detail.

=== Force A Rebuild ?

Is it possible to force *Travis* to rebuild and test a repo? Yes, this is possible. See the orange circle and arrow at the right ? Click that button to submit a rebuild request to *Travis*.

NOTE: there are additional tabs we can use to drill down for more detail

 . `Branches` - to view results by branch within this repo
 . `Build History` - shows the events within this branch of this repo, and we can drill down into more detail if needed
 . `Pull Requests` - don't know about this so you can dig into it if you need it.

''''

=== Even More !

[.thumb]
image:Screenshot9.png[Requests,role="thumb",float="right"]To review even more details, click the `Settings` button at the right side. This reveals three more choices. The one i like is `Requests` as it provides a list of the most recent events in the build life of this repo.

=== Do It !

IMPORTANT: Ok, it's your turn ! Go forth and integrate !  image:travisIcon.png[]
